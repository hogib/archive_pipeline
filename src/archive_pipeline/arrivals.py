"""Cached iasp91 travel times, shared instead of re-implemented per script.

Three scripts each grew their own copy of the same thing: a `TauPyModel`, a dict
keyed on a rounded (distance, depth) grid, and a try/except returning None. They
differed only in grid resolution and in whether the phase list was a parameter,
which is the shape duplication takes when it is copied rather than imported.

**The grid is the point, not an optimisation detail.** A catalogue run asks for
tens of thousands of arrivals, and an uncached `get_travel_times` call is
milliseconds; rounding distance and depth to a few kilometres collapses that to a
few hundred distinct calls. Travel time varies slowly enough over a 5 km cell
that the error is far below the location error already present in the catalogue
(median RMS residual 0.42 s for AFAD), so the approximation is free in practice.

**`grid_km` is explicit and not defaulted quietly**, because changing it changes
every arrival a caller computes. Callers keep the resolution they were written
with -- 5 km for the signal-to-noise and association work.
